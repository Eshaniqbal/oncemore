## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Walnut Brown (#773f1a) to convey earthy tones and sustainability.
- Background color: Off-White (#f8f5f1), a desaturated tone from the walnut family. Provides a calm, muted backdrop that reflects the brand's sustainable focus and adds a touch of warmth without being too visually distracting.
- Accent color: Olive Green (#7f8c3d), slightly greener hue offset from the browns of the theme; this adds a fresh organic look without overpowering the walnut background.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a serif, for headings and titles to reflect a luxurious and elegant aesthetic.
- Body font: 'Inter', a sans-serif, for body text and descriptions for clean readability and modern appeal.
- Use simple, outlined icons to match the minimalist design; icons should relate to clothing types and site navigation.
- Implement a grid layout for product listings to create a structured and visually appealing display; prioritize clean, breathable spacing.
- Use fade-in animations when loading content and smooth slide transitions for navigation, leveraging Framer Motion for fluidity.
